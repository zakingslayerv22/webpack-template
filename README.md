The project takes us through the workflow for ES6 modules and bundling with Webpack. I think this workflow or some parts of it will stick with javascript developers for a long time in their careers. We also had the opportunity to pull some more DOM manipulation. It was overall a good experience and I am looking forward to what The Odin Project has next in the curriculum.

I'll keep in touch by God's Grace.

On y va!
