The project takes us through the workflow for ES6 modules and bundling with Webpack. I think this workflow or some parts of it will stick with javascript developers for a long time in their careers. We also had the opportunity to pull some more DOM manipulation. It was overall a good experience and I am looking forward to what The Odin Project has next in the curriculum.

I'll keep in touch by God's Grace.

On y va!

Clean up files

Remove unneeded files.
Reset the index.html to
boilerplate. Clear the
index.css and leave only 
basic resets. Clear the
index.js so that it only
imports the css. 

Add the dist directory 
to gitignore.
